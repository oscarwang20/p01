# Description
The user will be assigned one randomly generated "target word" by the Random Word API. They will also be given a distinct, also
randomly generated, starting word and a selection of related words that appear as links.
Related words are any words that appear as synonyms for the current word given by the Thesaurus API, and as links in the current word's Wikipedia entry given by the Wikipedia API.

The aim of the game is to get closer to the word in the middle by strategically choosing words that relate to the previous word. The total score at the end of the game is calculated by the total number of turns the user took.
